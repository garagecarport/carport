<p>Pergola, Aluminum Frame And Polyester Roof, Powder Coated A carport (also known as a porte cochere) provides a covered space next to the home for one or more vehicles to park or drop off groceries or people without going to the hassle of entering a garage. We set out illustrated diagrams setting out all key dimensions including width, depth and more. Plot out the space for the carport. If you�re looking to update your carport, check out these driveways first for inspiration.</p>
