<p>What To Do When My Garage Door Will Not Open Garage Doors Garage Garage Design I checked the breaker inside the house and a few were tripped which were the ones that supply power to garage. If your home is out of power and you have no backup sources your garage will be stuck in the closed position. So you shut off your main panels main breaker and your garage didnt trip. If you are experiencing lost power in a garage there may be a tripped a GFI outlet.</p>
